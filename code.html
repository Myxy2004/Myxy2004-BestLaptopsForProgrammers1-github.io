		<h2 class="sub-heading"><u>Why I Made This Site</u></h2>
		<p class="paragraph">I made this website as when I was looking for a laptop, there was sites for gamers, students ect. But there wasn't a site made for programmers. So I figured i could make a website to help fellow coders out there to look for laptops. For now I will be including 5 computers. I also made his site because at the moment I am 13 years old (brithday 14th of October 2004) and when I am older I want to work at google, so this is gonna be used in the list of projects and work experience that I am gonna use to get that job. This site will have constant updates, changisng the appearance and design of the page. Not to mention the laptops changing as technology is for ever advancing it will go from 5th being the lowest (but still great) to 1st (being the best in my opinion).</p>
		<h3>the list:</h3>

	    <p class="paragraph">The lenovo ideapad is a very powerful computer with high end spec for the price it is at. The hybrid storage could be a bit more on the ssd side and the hdd side should be a bit less but for the price... no complaints. This laptop will run most of your programs with a breeze. It's instant fingerprint reader allows quick and secure entry to the laptop. its low weight and sleek design also makes it ideal for programmers who are mobile, though the battery life isn't too great(3 hours 43 minutes).</p><br></br>

		<p class="paragraph">The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a great laptop overall. It will do most of your tasks. It's very slim design and low weight makes it the perfect laptop for mobile programmers. The 16 GB ram is perfect for running the coding programs you need. The Surface Pro 4 is also designed for art and modeling. With the surface pen you can design as much as you want. Though the pen has been pulled from the package with the laptop so you need to order it seperatly, and it is £100.</p><br></br>
